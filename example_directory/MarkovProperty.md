# Introduction

The Markov property emphasizes that the future state of a system is determined solely by its current state, with no dependence on its history. This characteristic simplifies the modeling of systems that exhibit randomness, underpinning the creation of Markov processes such as Markov Chains and Brownian Motion. These models are essential tools for predicting system behavior over time by focusing only on the present state to infer future states. The Markov property streamlines the analysis of complex stochastic systems to develop and apply predictive models without delving into the system's entire past.

# Identifying Markov Properties

# Mathematical Symbols
- **$\xi(t)$** represents the random variable at time $t$.
- **$P\{\ldots\}=P\{\ldots\}$** denotes the probability of transitioning from one state to another, for example $$P\{X_{n+1}=i|X_{n}=j\}$$
  represents the probability of moving from state $j$ to state $i$. This equality asserts the Markov property, emphasizing that the transition probability only depends on the current state.
- **$X_{t_n} = i_n$**  indicates the random variable $X$ at time $t_n$​ is in state $i_n$​.
- **$\chi^2$** chi-squared test statistic, a measure used to test the hypothesis about the distribution of observed data.
- **$f_{ij}$​** frequency of transitions from state $i$ to state $j$.
- **$p\cdot j$​** marginal probability, or the overall probability of transitioning to state $j$, regardless of the starting state.
